When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When coloborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pull in order to control the changes to the local repository.  This allows new code to be intgretated
    with existing code before syncing with other possible changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are unique to GitHub and are a gitHub to GitHub clone of a repository.  A clone is a copy of a repository
    including all metadata either local to local or remote to local.  A branch is just a label withing a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This allows working with the latest changes offline (i.e. no internet connectivity)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    One might collaborate with a shared source tree.  Directly viewing changes would be easier.  All other
    aspects of coloborating would be more difficult.  Especially, working offline and merging later.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
